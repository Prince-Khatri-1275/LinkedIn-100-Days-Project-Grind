# DFS

$ start with a randomly selected tile
start = random(tile from tiles)

## DFS as Path Finding Algorithm the solver

$ Make an stack with start as its element
stack = [start]

$ Loop steps
    $ Pop the stack i.e. take last element of the stack
    currentTile = pop(stack)

    $ Add currentTile to visited set/list

    $ If currentTile is goal return its path
    if isGoal(currentTile) ret path2node(currentTile)

    $ Else add every one of its unvisited children or neighbor to stack
    for neigh in neighs(currentTile) if neigh not in visited append to stack
